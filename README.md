## 🕵️‍♂️ Mission Briefing
Hi, I'm **Anurag Kumar**, a Full Stack Web Developer.  
Standard resumes are boring. As a developer, I believe my resume should demonstrate my skills, not just list them.  
This project is a **Hybrid Resume**—a fusion of a professional document and an interactive web app.

### 🌟 Live Demo
